Subject: Potential Release Impact Due to DevOps Infrastructure Support

Hi [Application Manager's Name] and [Project Sponsor's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention a potential risk that may impact our upcoming release. We have encountered some challenges related to DevOps infrastructure support that could delay our timeline.

The issue is currently being assessed by the team, and we are working closely with DevOps to address it as quickly as possible. However, depending on the complexity of the issue and the time required to resolve it, the release schedule may be affected.

I will keep you updated on the progress and provide a more detailed assessment as soon as we have more information. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
